​I'm in point A and I need to go to point B as fast as I can. There are two roads where you can leave the A, route 10 and 11. After I arrive to point between A and B, I have only two bridges I can choose from to point B. The traffic is unpredictable, so it can happen a traffic jam. The time I need to cross will be different either case. And sometimes I am redirected even though I have chosen the other direction.
My goal is:

- Optimize my strategy to gain as much reward as you can​
- Implement Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo and Temporal Differences algorithms and compare their results​
- Write a short (few sentences) study why they perform different.​
- Run simulation for each of the for 1000 episodes​
- Create graphs about the different algorithms performance. (use matplotlib)
- Finish these tasks for both sets of input data​
