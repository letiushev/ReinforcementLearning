Given the OpenAI environment (CartPole-v1). During the project work, I need to implement and use, study and compare the following algorithms:

    Deep Q-learning (DQN),
    Double DQN,
    Dueling DQN
    Policy iteration method that uses the advantage function ( actor critic methods)

There are trials, problem solution by using these algorithms and the paper study(RLPaper.pdf) about my work, experiences and finds.
